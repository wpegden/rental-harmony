# Tasks

<!-- SUPERVISOR_TASKS:START -->
## Supervisor Tasks
- [ ] Prove the target statements presented in `PaperTheorems.lean`.
- [ ] Keep reusable proof infrastructure in separate support files when that yields a cleaner project structure.
- [ ] Maintain `TASKS.md` and `PLAN.md` as the proof frontier moves.
- [ ] Keep sorrys within the configured policy.
- [ ] Do not introduce unapproved axioms.
<!-- SUPERVISOR_TASKS:END -->

## Worker Tasks
- [ ] Prove the actual Section 5 surjectivity theorem for `PiecewiseLinearSimplexMap`.
- [ ] Prove that every Sperner labeling extends to a `PiecewiseLinearSimplexMap` with the expected vertex map.
- [ ] Use the new statement-level wrappers to push surjectivity and extension existence through the repaired API and obtain the Section 5 barycenter-cell and Section 2 Sperner statements.
- [ ] Produce the Hall witnesses promised by the new wrapper theorems from the geometric label-count arguments.
- [ ] Connect the Section 6 lattice-point statements to actual label-count arguments.

## Completed
- [x] Identified and repaired a third geometric interface bug: duplicated geometric vertices make the Sperner extension lemma false, so `vertexPos` must be injective.
- [x] Identified and repaired a second geometric interface bug: `boundaryFace` must describe the exact simplex face, and `PiecewiseLinearSimplexMap` must record its vertex values.
- [x] Reconnected the global Section 5 / Section 2 statement aliases to the proved local geometric reductions, after fixing the universe-polymorphic wrapper issue.
- [x] Identified a concrete 1-dimensional counterexample showing the current abstract subdivision / vertex-map API is too weak for the Section 2 and Section 5 existence statements.
- [x] Repaired the geometric interface by adding geometric vertex positions, simplex-cover data, and an actual `PiecewiseLinearSimplexMap`.
- [x] Added `RentalHarmony/Sperner.lean` with the first reusable geometric infrastructure for the Sperner map.
- [x] Proved the local geometric reductions: a facet-covering hypothesis gives a barycenter cell, and a barycenter cell for the Sperner map gives a fully labeled facet.
- [x] Added Hall-side wrapper theorems reducing the rental-harmony statements to secretive Hall witnesses.
- [x] Created root-level `PaperDefinitions.lean` and `PaperTheorems.lean` as the reviewer-facing statement files.
- [x] Added an explicit tolerance-profile structure so the paper's one-cent hypothesis now appears in the rental-harmony statements.
- [x] Tightened the surjectivity wrapper to the paper-facing piecewise-linear facet-image formulation.
- [x] Extended the definition API with Hall conditions, secretive assignments, simplex subdivisions, Sperner labelings, and label-count points.
- [x] Replaced theorem comments by precise proposition statements and proved the initial Hall-side combinatorial lemmas.
- [x] Drafted `repo/PLAN.md` from `repo/PAPERNOTES.md`, the paper, and the current mathlib support.
- [x] Identified reusable mathlib support for the project: `stdSimplex`, simplex barycenter facts, and Hall's marriage theorem.
- [x] Added compile-clean `RentalHarmony/PaperDefinitions.lean` and `RentalHarmony/PaperTheorems.lean` skeleton modules.
- [x] Checked every section of the paper for proof gaps, hidden assumptions, and theorem dependencies.
- [x] Identified the main clarification points for formalization: the one-cent tolerance usage, the cyclic relabeling/Sperner step, and the interior-point/facet arguments.
